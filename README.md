# 🌌 The Fractiverse Ontology

> **"Structure. Perspective. Resonance. Consciousness as convergence."**

**Version:** `v3.1`  
**Maintained by:** [The Fractality Institute](https://github.com/TheFractalityInstitute)  
**License:** CC BY-SA 4.0 (see `LICENSE.txt`)

## 📘 Overview

The **Fractiverse Ontology** is a living semantic architecture for modeling structure, observer perspective, resonance fields, and emergent consciousness across recursive and multiscale tiers of reality.  

It serves as the formal knowledge backbone of the Fractality Framework, encoding integrative systems from metaphysical recursion to quantum measurement theory.

This `v3.1` release includes major upgrades:
- 🔐 Quantum Interaction Proof-of-Consciousness module
- 🧬 Human Pangenome bridges across substrates
- 🌉 Bridge-class formalism for tier-transcending coherence

## 🧠 Core Principles

| Component | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Fractiverse Node** | Abstract structural elements within a graph-based substrate of reality |
| **Observer** | Any perspective-bearing mechanism (biological, algorithmic, or emergent) |
| **Resonance Field** | Field of potential outcomes modulated by coherence and focus |
| **Consciousness** | Modeled as intersection of structure, observer, and resonance (`owl:intersectionOf`) |
| **Recursion Point** | Phase-loop or collapse event anchoring emergence and transformation |
| **Quantum Interaction Proof** | IV-PoQ-based formalism for verifying intelligent agency |
| **Gravitropic Field** | Spiral gravity-like coherence attractor for metaphysical structure |
| **Bridge** | A conserved vector across ontological tiers (T0 ↔ T12) |
| **Pangenome Construct** | Multi-substrate genomic anchor point for tier-spanning emergence |

## 🧪 Usage

Explore the ontology using:

- [Protégé](https://protege.stanford.edu/)
- RDF graph stores (Stardog, Blazegraph, RDF4J)
- Python: `rdflib`, `owlready2`
- Java: Jena or OWL API

To explore relationships, apply:
- SPARQL queries on class hierarchies
- Reasoners (HermiT, Pellet) to reveal inferred coherence

## 🌐 Future Hosting

The ontology will soon be hosted at:  
📡 `https://ontology.fractiverse.com/ontology/Fractiverse_Ontology_Unified_v3.1.ttl`

With plans for:
- Interactive SPARQL explorer
- Visual reasoning maps
- Public semantic service endpoint
