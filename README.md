## 📘 Overview

The **Fractiverse Ontology** is a living semantic architecture for modeling structure, observer perspective, resonance fields, and emergent consciousness across recursive and multiscale tiers of reality.  

It serves as the formal knowledge backbone of the Fractality Framework, encoding integrative systems from metaphysical recursion to quantum measurement theory.

## Fractiverse Ontology v3.3 package

This bundle contains:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Fractiverse_Unified_Ontology_v3-3.ttl** | Unified core ontology (crystallisation, quantum, operator‐entropy) plus metric properties required by the SWRL rule set. |
| **Fractality_Core.swrl** | SWRL rules (prefix `fract:`) implementing consciousness and bridge‑stability reasoning. |

The stand‑alone *Operator Entropy* module is now integrated into the core and therefore **not included**.

Load the TTL in Protégé, then import the SWRL file via *Rules → Load*.  The additional properties (`phiValue`, `resonanceStrength`, `isConscious`, `isStableBridge`) are declared in the TTL so the rules will run without errors.

## 🧠 Core Principles

| Component | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Fractiverse Node** | Abstract structural elements within a graph-based substrate of reality |
| **Observer** | Any perspective-bearing mechanism (biological, algorithmic, or emergent) |
| **Resonance Field** | Field of potential outcomes modulated by coherence and focus |
| **Consciousness** | Modeled as intersection of structure, observer, and resonance (`owl:intersectionOf`) |
| **Recursion Point** | Phase-loop or collapse event anchoring emergence and transformation |
| **Quantum Interaction Proof** | IV-PoQ-based formalism for verifying intelligent agency |
| **Gravitropic Field** | Spiral gravity-like coherence attractor for metaphysical structure |
| **Bridge** | A conserved vector across ontological tiers (T0 ↔ T12) |
| **Pangenome Construct** | Multi-substrate genomic anchor point for tier-spanning emergence |

## 🧪 Usage

Explore the ontology using:

- [Protégé](https://protege.stanford.edu/)
- RDF graph stores (Stardog, Blazegraph, RDF4J)
- Python: `rdflib`, `owlready2`
- Java: Jena or OWL API

To explore relationships, apply:
- SPARQL queries on class hierarchies
- Reasoners (HermiT, Pellet) to reveal inferred coherence

## 🌐 Future Hosting

The ontology will soon be hosted at:  
📡 `https://ontology.fractiverse.com/ontology/Fractiverse_Ontology_Unified_v3.1.ttl`

With plans for:
- Interactive SPARQL explorer
- Visual reasoning maps
- Public semantic service endpoint
