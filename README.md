# Fractiverse Ontology

This repository contains the **Fractal Trinity Ontology (FTO)** and related semantic models developed by the Fractality Institute.

## Purpose

The **Fractal Trinity Ontology** was the original high-level schema for expressing the **triadic principle** across domains (Interior–Exterior–Relational, Energy–Information–Structure, etc.). It provided:

* A **conceptual bridge** between philosophy, physics, and consciousness studies
* A **symbolic layer** for reasoning about triads in OWL/TTL form
* A **pedagogical scaffold** for introducing the logic of triadic resonance

With the publication of the **Unified Resonance Framework (URF v5.0)**, this ontology is no longer the “final word” on triadic formalism. URF v5.0 has **subsumed the Trinity Ontology** into a complete mathematical theory of **triadic resonance, information geometry, and emergent spacetime**.

## Relationship to URF v5.0

* **URF v5.0** = physics-level substrate (field equations, predictions, experiments)
* **Fractal Trinity Ontology** = semantic-level interface (categories, symbolic reasoning, human accessibility)

Think of FTO as the **semantic twin** of URF v5.0:

* URF provides the **mathematical formalization** of triadic resonance
* FTO provides the **ontological scaffolding** for knowledge graphs, reasoning systems, and interdisciplinary communication

## Why Keep This Ontology?

1. **Ontology engineering** – symbolic reasoning in OWL/TTL requires explicit categories that equations can’t capture directly.
2. **Pedagogical bridge** – FTO remains a useful way to introduce triadic resonance to non-physicists.
3. **Interdisciplinary integration** – the ontology is an interface between URF physics and other domains (ethics, systems theory, AI).

## Current Status

* **Canonical physics reference**: [URF v5.0 Textbook](../URF-v5_0-Textbook-1e.pdf)
* **Semantic twin**: Fractal Trinity Ontology (this repo)

The ontology is now maintained as a **companion layer** to URF v5.0, not as a standalone framework.
