# ðŸ§  Fractiverse Ontology Documentation

Welcome to the **Fractiverse Ontology** public documentation hub.

This ontology is a modular, semantic framework designed to represent the interplay of structure, perspective, resonance, and recursive emergence. It supports philosophical modeling, technical interoperability, and experimental metaphysics.
